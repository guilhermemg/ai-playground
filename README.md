# AI Playground

A collection of AI experiments showcasing the power of language models (LLMs), agents, and LangChain. This repository contains various demonstrations and interactive examples to explore cutting-edge AI technologies in a hands-on, practical way. It is designed to showcase my expertise in:
- Building and deploying AI solutions.
- Creating intelligent agents for real-world applications.
- Integrating LLMs with APIs and external services.
- Working with frameworks like LangChain for managing agents, prompts, and chains.

The projects here are built to be both educational and practical, providing insight into how modern AI technologies can be applied in various domains.
