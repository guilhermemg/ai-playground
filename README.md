## Introduction

Welcome to my **AI Playground**! In this repository, I demonstrate various applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) using LangChain, as well as the development of autonomous agents that can perform complex tasks.

This repository is a way to showcase my skills in:
- Building and deploying AI solutions.
- Creating intelligent agents for real-world applications.
- Integrating LLMs with APIs and external services.
- Working with frameworks like LangChain for managing agents, prompts, and chains.

The projects here are built to be both educational and practical, providing insight into how modern AI technologies can be applied in various domains.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenAI API (GPT-3, GPT-4)**
- **LangChain** (for LLM workflows, agents, and chains)
- **FastAPI** (for building web APIs)
- **Requests** (for external API integration)
- **Pydantic** (for data validation)
- **python-dotenv** (for environment management)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-playground.git
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Weather API) in a `.env` file.

5. Run the examples:
   ```bash
   python example_file.py
   ```
